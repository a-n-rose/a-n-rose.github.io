			<h1>About</h1>
      			<p>I have a M.Sc. in clinical linguistics and a life-long appreciation of math and typing, which together have thrust me into the exciting world of digital signal processing via Python. My education is researched based, i.e. developing experiments and stimuli to study language development. My current intests lie in coding my way though the speech stream and all we can learn from it.</p>
