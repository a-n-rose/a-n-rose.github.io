			<h1>About</h1>
      			<p>I have a B.A. in psychology, a M.Sc. in clinical linguistics, and enjoy dancing, hiking, and more recently, learning Kung Fu.</p>
      			<p>Programming came unexpectantly into my life. It was winter in Finland, 2012, when a professor introduced me to acoustics and Python. Since then I use programming as my stage to learn, build, play, and teach about acoustics and beyond.
