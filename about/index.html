			<h1>About</h1>
      			<p>I have a B.A. in psychology, a M.Sc. in clinical linguistics, and I am a guest dancer in a Berlin-based <a href='http://sr-company.de/index_engl.htm'>dance company</a>. It took me a while to narrow it down, but I have a mild obsession with sound and what we humans can do with it.</p>
      			<p>In Finland, 2012 - the first semester of my master's program <a href='https://www.mastersportal.com/studies/11690/european-master-in-clinical-linguistics.html'>EMCL</a> - a professor introduced me to acoustics and programming. Since then I use programming as my stage to learn, build, play, and teach about acoustics and beyond.
