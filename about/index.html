			<h1>About</h1>
      			<p>I have a msc. in clinical linguistics and a life-long appreciation of math which have thrust me into the exciting world of digital signal processing via Python. My education is researched based, i.e. developing experiments and stimuli to study language development. My current intests lie in exploring what all we can learn from the speech stream, particularly in the context of code.</p>
