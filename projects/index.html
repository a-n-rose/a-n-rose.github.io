				<li><a href="/projects/mimic-master">Mimic Master</a></li>
				<p>A game that tests your mimicking skills: it plays a sound and the user mimics it, or tries. If the user can collect enough points, they will be deemed 'Mimic Master!'</p>
				<p>I generated fingerprints of both the target sound and the user's mimic, and I also compared the pitch patterns of each. The more similar these are, the more points the user earns.</p>
