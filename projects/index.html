			<p>Below is a brief description of the various projects I have worked on or am working on, along with a link to a corresponding blog post.</p>
			
			<ul class="projects_list">

				<li> <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/projects/round5/">NoIze</a>: Open Source Smart Noise Filter</li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I developed an open source smart noise filter in Python for Prototype Fund (round 5). My manager Peggy Sylopp and I present our work on September 2nd, 2019.
                                        </li>

				<li> <a href="/2019/01/13/workshop-pyladies-deeplearning-speech.html">Workshop</a>: Train and Implement a CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM with Speech Data </li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I led a workshop for PyLadies in Berlin on February 12, 2019. I first provided a background for convolutional neural networks and long short-term neural networks, as well as different speech features relevant for machine learning, especially deep learning. The participants experimented with different feature extraction techniques, visualizing what those looked like, as well as training various models and testing those models with their own speech.
                                        </li>

				<li> <a href="/2018/12/03/prepping-speech-CNN-and-LSTM.html">Replication Study</a>: I built a clinical language classifier with stacked ConvNet and LSTM neural networks in Python </li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I used freely available speech data, specifically clinical speech data, to see how well a ConvNet+LSTM neural network classifier did as compared with only a ConvNet or LSTM alone. I implemented these models in Python using Keras, with challenging modules such as the TimeDistributed module.
                                        </li>

				<li> <a href="/2018/11/16/building-babyname-recommender.html">Babyname Recommender</a> with KMeans Clustering </li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>Using US babyname data, spanning from 1880 - 2017, I built a name recommender that allows users to rate (boy, girl, or all) names, for several different searches. Based off of the user's likes and dislikes, recommendations get made and the performance of those recommendations gets evaluated. In this project I explore the influence of feature selection on the recommender's success.

				<li> <a href="/2018/09/28/english-speech-to-ipa.html">English speech to international phonetic alphabet (IPA) model</a> </li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I am using speech and annotation data from Voxforge, as there are multiple databases of various languages publicly available. I am experimenting with loosely aligning annotation and speech data to see if they can be used to build useful models. If so, I will further explore the annotation and speech data of additional languages. Ideas for uses:
                                            <li>Speech to text/IPA: Documents what a person says and can also be repeated via synthesis, i.e. with <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">Espeak</a>.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Pronunciation guide: Takes in a word from an unknown language, translates it to IPA, and the IPA gets translated into the user's language of choice (ideally one they know).
                                            </li>
                                        </li>
					</ul>
			
			
			
				<li> Build an <a href="/2018/09/11/emotion-classifier.html">Emotion (of Speech) Classifier </a> </li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>This project is inspired by my desire to see how well neural networks train on MFCC data in emotion classification contexts.</li>
					</ul>
			
				<li> <a href="/2018/09/09/ID-SLI-speech.html">Flag Child Speech for SLI: </a> </li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>After dipping my toes into the waters of deep learning and speech, I had to see how a long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network did with children's clinical (Specific Language Impairment) vs healthy speech. I'm just starting out on this journey and stoked to see where it leads.</li>
					</ul>

				<li> Language Classifier: <a href="/2018/08/22/language-classifier.html">  ANN </a> vs <a href="/2018/09/07/language-classifier-LSTM.html">LSTM</a></li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I embarked on this project to learn how to build deep neural networks to identify features in speech. This classifier identifies the language the speaker is speaking. The algorithm is trained thus far on English,German, and Russian.</li>
					<li>A follow-up project will be to identify features of language pathology via a mobile recording device</li>
					</ul>
					
				<li><a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2018/08/24/mimic-master-pitchcurve-vs-fingerprint.html">Mimic Master</a></li>
                    
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>A game that tests your mimicking skills: it plays a sound and the user mimics it, or tries. If the user can collect enough points, they will be deemed 'Mimic Master!'</li>
					<li>I generated fingerprints of both the target sound and the user's mimic, and I also compared the pitch patterns of each. The more similar these are, the more points the user earns.</li>
					</ul>
