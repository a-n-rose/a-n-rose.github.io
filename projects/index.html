			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>Below is a brief description of the various projects I have worked on or am working on, along with a link to a corresponding blog post.</p>

			<ul class="projects_list">
				<li><a href="/projects/mimic-master">Mimic Master</a></li>
				
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>A game that tests your mimicking skills: it plays a sound and the user mimics it, or tries. If the user can collect enough points, they will be deemed 'Mimic Master!'</li>
					<li>I generated fingerprints of both the target sound and the user's mimic, and I also compared the pitch patterns of each. The more similar these are, the more points the user earns.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><a href="/projects/language-classifier">Language Classifier</a></li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I embarked on this project to learn how to build deep neural networks to identify features in speech. This classifier identifies the language the speaker is speaking. The algorithm is trained thus far on German and English, but more languages will be added.</li>
					<li>A follow-up project will be to identify features of language pathology via a mobile recording device</li>
					</ul>
				<li><a href="/projects/babyname-recommender">Baby Name Recommender</a></li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>This recommender helped my husband and me with our search for a name for our first child! I personally wasn't happy with the name apps available so I decided to build my own.</li>
					<li>The recommendation system has several versions, from very simple to quite complex. Thousands and thousands of names were first clustered and recommendations were either built on those (simple version) or the recommendations adapted to the user's likes and dislikes of names.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
