			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>Below is a brief description of the various projects I have worked on or am working on, along with a link to a corresponding blog post.</p>
			
			<ul class="projects_list">
				<li> <a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2018/09/09/ID-SLI-speech.html">Flag Child Speech for SLI: </a> 
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>After dipping my toes into the waters of deep learning and speech, I had to see how a long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network did with children's clinical (Specific Language Impairment) vs healthy speech. I'm just starting out on this journey and stoked to see where it leads.</li>
					</ul>

			<ul class="projects_list">
				<li> Language Classifier: <a href="/2018/08/22/language-classifier.html">  ANN </a> vs <a href="/2018/09/07/language-classifier-LSTM.html">LSTM</a></li>
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>I embarked on this project to learn how to build deep neural networks to identify features in speech. This classifier identifies the language the speaker is speaking. The algorithm is trained thus far on English,German, and Russian.</li>
					<li>A follow-up project will be to identify features of language pathology via a mobile recording device</li>
					</ul>
					
				<li><a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2018/08/24/mimic-master-pitchcurve-vs-fingerprint.html">Mimic Master</a></li>
                    
				<ul class="project_description">
					<li>A game that tests your mimicking skills: it plays a sound and the user mimics it, or tries. If the user can collect enough points, they will be deemed 'Mimic Master!'</li>
					<li>I generated fingerprints of both the target sound and the user's mimic, and I also compared the pitch patterns of each. The more similar these are, the more points the user earns.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
