title: "Forever Vocab: collect word treasures you find and get tested on them later"

Below I think about what I would like in my ideal vocab app. The one I'm actually creating though, while more humble is still helpful! The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/Vocab-Collector-and-Tester">here</a>.

What is a vocab tool that would work for me? One that allows me to collect words no matter where I'm reading them, save them to a themed list, and then have that app test me on those words with different measures: 1) multiple choice, 2) fill in the blank, 3) synonyms/antonyms. And maybe 4) pronunciation. (The last measure would likely be several versions down the road).

My idea thus far is to have the user copy and paste the word into a 'new word' text input box, and the app collect the definition(s) and sentence examples from on-line to use in making quizzes for the user. My first thought (and maybe yours too) is Linguee! They have multiple sentence examples in at least two languages. I checked their robots.txt file and it appears they don't want any scraping/crawling done to their site. There is a Linguee API I found on GitHub. My next step is to see if it is acceptable to use it for what I deem as a very good purpose: increasing the complexity in which we (especially me) see the world. (I'm excited that I just learned the word 'quaver'. The anticipation of all the other words awaiting me is killing me, as well as the disappointment in all the ones I've 'learned' and forgotten.)
