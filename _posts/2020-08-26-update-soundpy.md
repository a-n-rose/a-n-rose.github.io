For the most part of 2020 I continued building onto the <a href="https://notebooks.ai/a-n-rose">'sound playground'</a> I put together in 2019 for the project <a href="https://github.com/pgys/NoIze">NoIze</a>, (PyCon DE and PyData Berlin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ0f2x49Imc&feature=youtu.be">talk</a>) which focused on noise classification and filtering. What came out? 

<p style="font-weight: bold;">SoundPy! (<a href="https://aislynrose.bitbucket.io/">docs</a>)</p> 

The goal with this tool is to develop something in Python that I myself as a research-based developer want to use when working with and analyzing sound, especially in the context of deep learning.

While I was able to publish alpha versions of  SoundPy (GitHub <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/Python-Sound-Tool">repo</a>) to PyPi in August, as I was making preparations for a more stable release, I gave birth to my second child! However, a less buggy version of SoundPy is available on the <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/Python-Sound-Tool/tree/development">development branch</a> on GitHub. As my new little one gets more and more independent, I will be able to continue to debug and improve SoundPy. If he's anything like my first, I should be able to do so onwards of January 2021.

So if you come across bugs, don't hesitate to create issues on GitHub - it just may take a bit of time until I can give them the time they deserve.


Best wishes for health all around!
