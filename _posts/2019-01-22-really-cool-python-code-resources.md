I'll list here resources that offer you a peek into how people use Python code 


#### Paroose around <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. 

Just enter in topics your interested in and see what repositories come up. Some code is better, some worse, but it's a great way to get a feel for the difference. 

#### Examples of Python <a href="https://www.programcreek.com/python/">search engine</a>

This one shows you several open source projects where a specific python tool/module/library is used.  

#### <a href="">Project Euler</a>: once you solve a problem, you see how others have done the same, with various programming languages/ techniques

When you have a moment to challenge yourself..
