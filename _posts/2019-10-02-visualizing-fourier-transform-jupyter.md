title: "Finally did it! Visualizing the Fourier Transform in Jupyter"

Well, I suppose I finally got a first version of visualizing the Fourier transform in Jupyter finished.. or.. online rather. Let's hope for many more and better versions to come. 

If you are curious... do check out the <a href="https://notebooks.ai/a-n-rose/visualizing-the-fourier-transfrom-in-python-4f954bbf">Jupyter Lab notebook</a> I've put together. 

And who couldn't be, really, knowing that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier">Joseph Fourier</a> traveled along with Napoleon to Egypt back in his day?! Oh the life of a mathematician!

If you would prefer to trip out on some splendid Fourier series visuals, I only say: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=568s">you must</a>. You won't see anything the same again.
