I thought I was a desert person, someone who could handle heat. Due to my everpresent sulkiness since the daily temperatures began hovering around 35 degrees, I am facing an identity crisis. Another item on the 'self-improvement list': Be less sensitive to heat.  Don't make yourself dependent on air conditioning. Free yourself from your physical world...

I hate repeating goals I thought I'd accomplished. This heat fucking sucks. 

To distract myself from my constant human failures, as well as the heat, let's bring out to the front a goal I most definitely have not failed at (yet... not even attempted, actually): to blog about my projects and my career in software, despite not having a computer science degree and also being a mother. And a woman. To up the frankness levels, I should say "my career in development." 

I'm a white lady, who had divorced parents: a wealthy, well-meaning, clueless father, whom I saw appx 3 times a year, and a struggling, dedicated mother. For several years I offered them the perfunctory resentment that all kids do, I suppose. As a kid I did very well in school and became a mini-star at my local dance school. Anger began boiling up in me, particularly in high school, as I became increasingly aware of the awkward and childish atmosphere adults handled gender relations in the United States (I currently live in Germany, partly due to my experiences back home). Unfortunately, this choice of anger pushed me away from what I really enjoyed: math. I loved math and typing as a kid; I'm confident had I been in a healthier environment, and by this I mean a culture that doesn't doubt its girls of intellect and boys of empathy, I would have come into contact with programming and computer science at an earlier age. But, I didn't. So when it came to college, I wanted to have as few men around me as possible. My dream college was Mount Holyoke. I got in; the fees were too high. So I chose Goucher College, a was-all female college. Long story short, I let my anger get in the way of what tickles my brain. While Goucher is a good college, it is not known for its IT program and I did not come into contact with programming there. 

It took me moving to Germany a year after I graduated, then getting into a master's program set in Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands, called European Masters in Clinical Linguistics. It was during the long, cold, fairy-tale winter in Finland when that computer obsessed professor pushed the dredded code onto us poor linguists. I did not like him for a long time. Until he became one of my favorite professors of my entire education. Because of him, I finally got into touch with what not only makes sense to me, is a total blast.
