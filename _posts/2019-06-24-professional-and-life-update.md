title: "Blog Hiatus: Professional Life Update"

I haven't written or updated my blog in several months. I have also not contributed anything on <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose">Git Hub</a> for the same amount of time. I just wanted to offer an update about what's been going on. 

After my <a href="/2019/01/13/workshop-pyladies-deeplearning-speech.html">workshop</a> this past February, I started my first real gig as a developer. My colleague applied to <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/">Prototype Fund</a> to build an open source smart noise filter. Prototype Fund liked her application and offered her funding. However, she needed a developer to see it through, someone who had worked with deep learning and acoustic data. <a href="http://berlin.pyladies.com/">PyLadies Berlin</a> (for whom I did the workshop) connected the two of us, and together we grounded a GbR / Civil Law Partnership to lead the project <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/projects/round5/">\\NoIze//</a>.

Since then I've been researching and building software for the smart filter (on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/">Bitbucket</a>) and learning a freaking ton about digital signal processing, especially the math behind it. (And other stuff of course as well, but my Blog and Git Hub account was what suffered)

I have to admit, I don't really chill out until I have something working, so while the project is very much part-time (more like quarter-time :/), I put in the hours until I had set up working software. Now that I've got a smart filter running, I am now 'only' working on the documentation. While that does take time, I feel much more relaxed and free to pursue other projects, one of which is to build some sort of application with <a href="http://densepose.org/">DensePose</a> analyzing movement or something along those lines.

Regarding \\NoIze//, my colleague and I are applying to show our work at <a href="https://de.pycon.org/">PyCon DE & PyData Berlin</a> and I am thinking of submitting to the <a href="http://www.saneworkshop.org/sane2019/">SANE Workshop 2019</a> (I will be attending it, so might as well) and possibly to others. I will be sure to also showcase our final project here, which will be finished by the end of this August.

Thanks for reading and I wish you a fulfilling day and week!
