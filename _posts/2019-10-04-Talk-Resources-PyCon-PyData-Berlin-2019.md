# Aislyn's resources for <a href="https://de.pycon.org/program/pydata-jzw9he-take-control-of-your-hearing-accessible-methods-to-build-a-smart-noise-filter-peggy-sylopp-aislyn-rose/">the talk</a>:

**Take control of your hearing: Accessible methods to build a smart noise filter**

## Smart noise filter

The smart noise filter functionality I built: <a href="https://github.com/pgys/NoIze">NoIze</a>

## Sound Playground

My <a href="https://notebooks.ai/a-n-rose">interactive space</a> for working with sound in JupyterLab. (Recently some labs weren't loading, so if you encounter problems.. you're not alone..)

## Errors? 

Experiencing problems using your own sound? They are probably not compatible with the software/ online environment. This <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/python-sound-prep#prepare-audio-for-jupyter-lab">repo</a> should be able to help with that.

## Visualization

If you would like to visualize sound (plot or .png file), you can do that with <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/python-sound-prep#visualizing-sound">this resource</a>. Visualize the sound in the time domain (sound wave) and in the frequency domain (MFCC and FBANK features)

## Datasets

A collection of <a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2019/01/06/resources-publicly-available-speech-databases.html">publicly available datasets</a>

## Background Resources

### Filtering / Digital Signal Processing

This book, <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Speech-Enhancement-Theory-and-Practice-Second-Edition/Loizou/p/book/9781138075573">Speech Enhancement: Theory and Practice, by P.C. Loizou</a> was somewhat approachable with respect to handling sound and filtering it for enhancing speech, especially in applications of code.

### Deep Learning / Architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks etc.

The <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learing Book</a> was also very helpful in increasing understanding of CNNs in an accessible manner.
