title: "Language Classifier: Using public speech databases to train deep neural networks to ID types of language spoken"

This is in the works of getting the kinks out: first downloading lots of English and German speech data, extracting their MFCCs (with some environmental noise thrown in the mix), and then training various types of deep neural networks. 

To see where the reprository is currently, click <a href = "https://github.com/a-n-rose/language-classifier">here</a>. 

As I train the algorithms and add more languages to train them, I'll update this post.
