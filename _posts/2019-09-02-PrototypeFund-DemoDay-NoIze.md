Today is <a href='https://prototypefund.de/demo-day/'>Demo Day!</a> My colleague and I are presenting the software \\ \\NoIze/ /, with a <a href='https://notebooks.ai/a-n-rose/noize-demo-360a3df2'>demo</a> I've put together. To checkout the project in more detail, take a look at the <a href='https://aislynrose.bitbucket.io/'>documentation</a> or <a href='https://github.com/pgys/NoIze'>code repository</a> 

If you don't have an account with notebooks.ai, you can create a free one <a href='https://i.notebooks.ai/i/qrtJj3'>here</a>. With or without an account, you can see the notebooks I've put together, mostly dealing with sound <a href='https://notebooks.ai/a-n-rose'>here</a>.
