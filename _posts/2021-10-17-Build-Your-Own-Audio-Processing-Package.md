# Audio Processing

There is a lot one can do with audio. I attempt to tap into that in a workshop for [PyLadies Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Hamburg/events/278588912/) on Oct. 19, 2021 called:

## Build Your Own Audio Processing Package Using Poetry

You can access the workshop materials [at this GitHub repo](https://github.com/a-n-rose/Build-Your-Own-Audio-Processing-Package-Using-Poetry).

I offer an intro into sound and audio visualization, processing, and manipulation. Various programming challenges (with reference 'answers') are offered as well. I want to inspire people to build their own tools (via Python), and what better way by using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)!

Note: if you are interested in Poetry, reference the README of the repo, linked above.
