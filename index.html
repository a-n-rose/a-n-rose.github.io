	<h1>Aislyn Rose: A Wave-Enthusiast Coder</h1>
	<p>I am an American living in Berlin and I spend my time playing with sound signals via all things Python, biking with my family, traveling, and enjoying the excitement and challenges of life as a parent.</p>
	<p>Here I will document my various projects and topics I'm currently exploring. I will try to get old projects up here as well. Older (untidied) projects can be explored on my <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose">GitHub</a> account, however.</p>
	<p>Read more about <a href="/about">me</a> or about <a href="/projects"> my projects.</a> </p>
